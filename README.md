# Explorify - A Location Recommender

Explorify is a location based recommender system which suggests a user various places
or location of interests based on their past navigation history from Google Maps. It
recommends various places within a particular range of distance and when the user is
travelling on a particular route, Explorify will also suggest the places which might be
of interest to the user. All one needs to do is to give the access to the Location History
from his/her Google Account and Explorify will analyze the data of the user's location
history and start giving out recommendations.

For example, suppose you're frequent to Library A and Book Store A, on the basis of
this data Explorify will suggest you about Library B and Book Store B which are also
in the small radius from you.
